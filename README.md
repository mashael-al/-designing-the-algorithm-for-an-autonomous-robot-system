We focused on designing an algorithm for an autonomous robotic system to transform a traditional food warehouse into a fully automated one without human intervention.

This project is part of a collaborative training program.

What we did:

We developed a detailed, step-by-step algorithm to guide the robot to receive orders, plan routes within the warehouse, pick up products, and deliver them to the packing station.

We simulated the robot's tasks using a Python program that simulated the movements, product picking, and order completion processes.

We allowed the program to accept dynamic input commands to flexibly execute tasks based on user requests.

This algorithm is a fundamental step toward building a fully automated warehouse robotic system, with the potential for future expansions in hardware design and advanced control technologies.
